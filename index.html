        <h2>Why I Built This Tool</h2>
        <p>Hey! I'm Mxolisi Prince Qongwani, a developer from South Africa. This tool was born out of personal frustration while shopping online.</p>
        <p>One day, I wanted to buy a screwdriver set for phone repairs from AliExpress. Like many South Africans, I struggled with getting my exact location for shipping. The process was frustrating - copying coordinates, converting them to addresses, making sure everything was accurate...</p>
        <p>That's when I thought: "Why not create a simple tool that automatically gets your precise location?" This app is the result - a free tool to help anyone get their exact address for online shopping, food delivery, or any other needs.</p>
        <p>As a fellow South African, I know the challenges we face with international shipping and precise locations. This tool is my way of making that process a little easier for everyone. 🇿🇦</p>
